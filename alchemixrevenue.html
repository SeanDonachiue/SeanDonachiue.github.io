<h4>Protocol Revenue (live charts created with <a href='https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/'>Flipside Crypto</a>, writeup last updated 04/13/2021)</h4>

<p>The Alchemix treasury receives a 10% cut of yield produced by user funds locked in the Yearn v2 DAI Vault each day.</p>

<p>This time series animation shows the treasury wallet balances since inception. We see ~$3mm of USDT and USDC deposited around march 14th from ftx and binance wallets but it's not clear who intiated these transfers. <br>Two days later ~14k ALCX leaves the treasury to one address (1) which acted as a distributor to several others. Most of these are farming in the ALCX pools. This coincided with the public announcement of a deal Alchemix made with Alameda Research. At the time, 14K ALCX was just shy of 20% of the supply. <br> After this, the USDT and USDC were transferred to one of the dev wallets (2) which sold these for DAI, then transferred to another dev wallet (3). The dai was lent out on aave and the Treasury currently holds this aDAI.</p>
